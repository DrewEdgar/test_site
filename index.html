					<div class="articleSubTitle">My name is Josh Dankerl,
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>I am a student at triOS College, currently enrolled in the Video Game Design and Development course.
			During my time at triOS I will be learning about how to document game development, use most common programming languages, 
			building, and maintaining a personal website. Outside of school I am taking online coding courses to help me better myself with the languages, as
			as well as a online Unity course to help better understand how Unity works.

					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
			We've all lived different lives, some better than others, but we are all one in the same in the end. I won't bore you with a life story,
			but I will say, rough journeys lead to a more interesting life. You learn how to do what ever it takes to get the job done at the end of the day,
			we don't give up easily, and we always help each other when we see others in a rut. When it comes to working, I am a great team player even though I may
			be quiet at first when meeting new people and I open up quickly around like minded people. I've enjoyed countless hours playing video games as a kid growing up,
			it was my escape from reality, that's why I am here now, to build the things that helped me get through my childhood.

					<div class="articleSubTitle">My Skills
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
			There have been a lot jobs I've done growing up, none that really relate to video games, but most of the skills learned in my previous jobs can be put into situations
			in video games. I've done construction work, bicycle mechanic, and worked in the fast food industry. With the knowledge of these jobs I am confident in dealing with people,
			can rationally think things through, and keep a level head in the work place under stress. I am currently learning the common programming languages in school and on
			my own time outside of school. I finished my HTML course in SoloLearn and was given a certificate, and I am currently taking the CSS and Java script course as well.
